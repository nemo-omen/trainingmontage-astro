This will be my first dummy post for this astro blog. 

I understand that there really should be more text here, so I'll just fill in with a little rambling about nothing much at all. Oddly, it's more challenging to write about nothing than it is to write about a predefined subject.

### Third level title

- Thing one
- Thing two
- This is the third thing
- Fourth thing

#### Fourth level title

```js
const hello = function(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

function goodbye(name) {
  return `Goodbye, ${name}! It was nice having you here!`;
}
```
Okay, so now we can move on to other elements to see how things stack up on the page.
